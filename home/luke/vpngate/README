	score > 450000
	speed > 40Mb

	status:  display current vpn connection status
	connect:  connect  to one of the select "good" vpn server and set up routing
	disconnect : disconnet from vpn server and revert routing table to default


	generally, "./vpngate.sh connect/disconnect" will be the major usage scenario most of time.

	every time a connect is executed, it will first disconnect. 

	You need enter "sudo" password while updating system routing table. 


	Enjoy!
